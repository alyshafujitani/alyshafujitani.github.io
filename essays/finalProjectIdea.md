### Overview 
The Problem
College students are always trying to find the perfect study spot whether it be on campus or in the community. They want to be able to sip on their coffee or drink of choice and study in the environment they learn the best in.

The Solution 
Perfect Spot is an application for UH Manoa students to find their perfect study spot whether it be at a library or a coffee shop. 

Approach 
The user can create a profile that allows him/her to select their study environment preferences, and the app will display a list of areas that meet the user's requirements.
Study environment preferences, which are already built into the app, and are modifiable by the admins may include:
- 24 hours
- Food/drink allowed
- Food/drink served
- Outside tables

### Mockup Page Ideas 
Some possible mockup pages include: 
Landing page 
User home page 
Admin home page 
User profile page 
Vendor page 
Add vendor page 
Todayâ€™s top picks page 

### Use Case Ideas 
Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system. 
New user goes to the landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. 
Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site. 
User goes to the landing page, logs in, looks for study spots
Users are notified of new coffee/boba shops in the area that are their ideal place to study

### Beyond the Basics 
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features: 
Notify students via email, twitter, SMS when new coffee/boba shops open up 
Automated updating of coffee/boba shop hours or information pertaining to their store.
Allow students to rate study spots
Integrated map functionality; note that some shops may change their location over the course of time. 
Provide feed of tweets from shops (some shops may use Twitter to advertise daily specials or deals).
