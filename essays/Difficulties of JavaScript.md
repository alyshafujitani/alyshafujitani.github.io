## Understanding the basics

Learning how to code is difficult and can be troublesome at times but after many restless hours of practice, you can become a pro. Going into ICS 314: Software Engineering, I only knew two languages, C and C++.  I was not prepared for JavaScript and did not know what to expect.  My brain had only programmed in C or C++ and I did not know what JavaScript looked like or if the logic was the same. After going through my first week of classes, I realized JavaScript was not very different from how I have programmed before.

Similar to C++, JavaScript problems have the same algorithms and similar ways of solving a problem.  The syntax is what is different and JavaScript has functions that are not included in C++.  The site  FreeCodeCamp helped a lot with learning the basics of JavaScript and the syntax needed to code. Going through the many different lessons on FreeCodeCamp, helped me to understand the logic behind JavaScript and how I need to switch my way of thinking if I want to know JavaScript. The beginning basic lessons on FreeCodeCamp were very similar to what I already knew from C and C++.  JavaScript basics were not new to me when I did them but the syntax was different, which is what I needed to know. Even though I knew most of the basics on JavaScript I still needed to practice and understand JavaScript a little more.

## Workout of the Day (WOD)

After completing the many different lesson on FreeCodeCamp, I went into doing the "Workouts of the Day" or better known as WODs.  The WODs were designed to enhance student's skills and test their knowledge on JavaScript. The two practice WODs that were assigned challenged my coding skills because I still was not used to JavaScript and could not think as fast as I was supposed to. The first practice WOD challenged me a lot because my coding skills are not up to par and thinking in JavaScript was still new to me. After taking an hour or so to figure out the WOD on my first attempt, I continued on many more attempts until I could figure it out in the specified time. Doing the first practice WOD helped me to understand how I need to improve my coding skills and practice JavaScript.

The second practice WOD was harder than the first one but I was prepared for this one. It took me a shorter amount of attempts to figure this WOD out and a little less time. After completing each practice WOD, I understood what my skill level was and what I needed to improve on. Each practice WOD was good practice for the real WOD and helps build my skills in JavaScript. Even though I am not the best at the WODs, I hope to improve my skills and become confident in coding in JavaScript. The WODs are given to help the students improve in JavaScript and I enjoy this type of learning. Even though the WODs are intimidating, I think it will help me understand JavaScript better than I understood C or C++.  

## JavaScript in General

After coding in JavaScript for the past two weeks, I've learned about how challenging it can be and the work I need to put in to learn it. I understand the very basics of JavaScript but I need to build upon the basics to understand the WODs and do well in coding JavaScript. Overall learning JavaScript is similar to learning C or C++.  When I learned both of those languages, I had to put in the work to understand the language and practice for hours. Learning a coding language does not happen overnight and I need to start putting in the time to become efficient in JavaScript. In general, I have enjoyed learning JavaScript and like the WODs because they challenge me intellectually.
