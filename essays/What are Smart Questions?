## Smart Questions are Important

Smart questions are essential for smart software engineers because it cuts down the time of looking up useless information or having to deal with answering questions that can be found in the frequently asked questions (FAQs) section.  As Eric Steven Raymond states in How to Ask Questions The Smart Way, “If you decide to come to us for help, you don’t want to be one of the losers”. When Raymond says “losers” he is referring to people who do not do their own work and ask questions to just get an answer before they try themselves to get the answer. When a “dumb” question is asked by said loser, it frustrates many hackers who answers these questions on StackOverflow because they do not want to spend their time answer questions that are easily found on the internet instead they want to be challenged with a hard, or smart, question. Smart software engineers may become hostile to “losers” because they are challenged intellectually and do not want to keep answering “baby” questions.
