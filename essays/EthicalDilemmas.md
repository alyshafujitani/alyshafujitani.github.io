## What is ethics in software engineering? 
When someone hears the word “ethics”, the first thing that comes to mind is not software engineering ethics but instead it may be about philosophy or some philosopher such as Socrates. Even though software engineering ethics is not a hot topic, it is still very important in the engineering world. As written in the adapted version of An Introduction to Software Engineering Ethics by Shannon Vallor and Arvind Narayanan, they mention different scenarios where software engineers must take ethics seriously in their lives.  One scenario and question written was, 
        “How many bridges are built today without the use of sophisticated computer programs to calculate expected load, geophysical  
         strain, material strength, and design resilience? A failure of these critical software systems can result in death or grievous          injury just as easily as a missing bolt or poorly designed gas tank.” 
This article makes a point in how important ethics is in a software engineering career, even though many people do not think about it. For me, ethics means in the context of software engineering is to ensure we write code that is ethically professional and ethical in our personal lives. Ethics does not only involve making sure the building does not collapse or a nail is screwed in the right place but it is also protecting people’s integrity through programs written for multiple websites and companies.
