## Personal interests 
Software engineering used to be a foreign term to me until I began my school career in computer engineering. I knew there were careers out there where people created websites, created applications, and did programming for a living but I did not know the name of that career until recently. Before starting my computer engineering degree, I was scared to learn programming because of how complicated it looked.  After my first year in my degree, I understood how programming worked and with determination it could become fun to do.  Once I found my interest in programming I understood the growing demand for software engineers and how interesting the career could be. It is a possible career path I looked into in creating my own application but my first path/dream is in cybersecurity. If cybersecurity ever fails I will definitely go into software engineering. Programming has become one of my passions and has opened my eyes to the many possible careers there are related to programming.
