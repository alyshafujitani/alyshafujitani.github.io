## Personal interests 
Software engineering used to be a foreign term to me until I began my school career in computer engineering. I knew there were careers out there where people created websites, created applications, and did programming for a living but I did not know the name of that career until recently. Before starting my computer engineering degree, I was scared to learn programming because of how complicated it looked.  After my first year in my degree, I understood how programming worked and with determination it could become fun to do.  Once I found my interest in programming I understood the growing demand for software engineers and how interesting the career could be. It is a possible career path I looked into in creating my own application but my first path/dream is in cybersecurity. If cybersecurity ever fails I will definitely go into software engineering. Programming has become one of my passions and has opened my eyes to the many possible careers there are related to programming. 

## Skills to develop 
After learning about software engineering and the many different paths that are open to me if I choose to go with that career, I realized there are many different skills I can develop.  One skill that I can develop would be writing.  In an article by Shubhro Saha, “Software engineers should write”, Saha explains how a key skill software engineers should have is writing because it promotes many other skills required for programming such as to think clearly. Writing is a valuable skill to develop from software engineering because writing is a skill that is required in all aspects of life.
