summary: Creating a website for students to find the perfect place to study on campus.
---

In ICS 314, the final project for the class was to create a web application in a group of three other people. Our project idea was called Cram Connect. Cram Connect is a website that students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa could use to find a place to study on campus and rate their favorite study spots. Students can create user profiles that list their name, major, favorite spot qualities, and favorite study spots. Each study spot or location listed their hours, a short description, a google map location, and their rating. Our goal for this web application was to provide a intuitive user interface that can provide an efficient system to allow students to discover and rate study spots in and around the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus.
